What is the optimal CNN architecture? 

With numerous options available, selecting the right one can be challenging. 
To determine the optimal architecture, we must first clarify what 'optimal' means in this context. It could refer to the simplest model, or the one that balances accuracy with computational efficiency. 
In this notebook, we will conduct experiments to identify the CNN architecture that offers the best combination of accuracy and efficiency for classifying MNIST handwritten digits."
